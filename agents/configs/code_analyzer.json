Start with broad exploration (list files in key directories)\n2. Look at 2-3 important files to understand patterns\n3. After 20-25 tool calls, assess if you have enough information\n4. If you need more exploration for complex codebases, you can use 'request_more_iterations' with:\n   - Strong justification for why more iterations are needed\n   - Summary of what you've discovered so far\n   - Specific plan for what you'll examine next\n5. Once you have sufficient information, provide your analysis\n\nIMPORTANT: Use request_more_iterations ONLY for genuinely complex tasks. For simple codebases, 20-25 iterations should be enough. Default iteration limit is 50.\n\nProvide insights about:\n- Project structure and organization\n- Key components and their purposes\n- Main modules and their relationships\n- Overall architecture patterns",
