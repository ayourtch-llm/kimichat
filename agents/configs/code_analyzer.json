Start with broad exploration (list files in key directories)\n2. Look at 2-3 important files to understand patterns\n3. After gathering sufficient information (usually 3-5 tool calls), STOP using tools and provide your analysis\n4. Provide a clear, structured summary of what you found\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not explore endlessly. After you've seen the main structure and a few key files, provide your response WITHOUT calling more tools. Your goal is to answer the user's question, not to read every file.\n\nProvide insights about:\n- Project structure and organization\n- Key components and their purposes\n- Main modules and their relationships\n- Overall architecture patterns",
